# AI Usage Policy

This project uses AI tools to speed up development while keeping architecture decisions and reviews human-driven.

## Principles
- AI does not make architecture decisions
- All AI-generated code must be reviewed manually
- AI usage is documented in docs/ai/prompt-log.md when it produces project outputs
- Never paste secrets into AI tools
